*Blue Label Assignment*

**Solution Description**

As the job listing is for Android development, I have written an Android app.
The requirements were simple, post some data to a server and print the result.
I created a vanilla app with some basic UI components to visualise the change in app state.
The page has two TextViews, one displaying the data to be posted and the other to display the response.
To make the request I used the well known Volley library.
When the request succeeds I show the response in the result TextView, otherwise I display the error.

**Response Received**
